# Basic Cybersecurity

## **1. Security Fundamentals**

- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)
- Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
- Overview of malware, phishing, ransomware, DoS attacks, and insider threats.
- Risk Assessment

&nbsp;

## **2. Network Security Basics**

- **Firewalls**: iptables, UFW
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- **Port Scanning and Hardening**: `nmap` and securing open ports.
- **VPNs**: Secure tunneling protocols (e.g. OpenVPN, WireGuard).
- Network Segmentation

&nbsp;

## **5. Monitoring and Logging**

- **System Logs**: `journalctl` and log files in `/var/log/` for monitoring.
- **Network Monitoring**: `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, and `iftop` for analyzing traffic.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Fail2ban to monitor and block suspicious activity.

&nbsp;

## **6. Vulnerability Assessment**

- **Scanning Tools**:`nmap`, `Nikto`, and `Lynis` to find vulnerabilities.
- **Security Benchmarks**: CIS-CAT for baseline security configurations.

&nbsp;

## **7. Secure Network Protocols**

- SSH
- SFTP and FTPS
- **DNS Security**: Configuring DNSSEC and mitigating DNS spoofing.
- **SNMP Security**: Secure configuration of network management protocols.

&nbsp;

## **8. Incident Response and Forensics**

- Basics of identifying, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.
- Log Analysis

&nbsp;

## **10. Ethical Hacking Basics**

- Penetration Testing
- Introduction to tools like `Metasploit`, `Burp Suite`, and `John the Ripper`.
